# Email backend

> Note: this is a work in progress, and not yet a deployed backend.

The email backend is deployed on [uberspace](https://uberspace.de) and mostly hosts the addition of clients to employers. It's written in php :disappointed: because. Use your own Mailgun key :smile:, you fill this in in your own `config.json`, just like `config.example.json`
