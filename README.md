# Email backend

> Note: this is a work in progress, and not yet a deployed backend.

The email backend is deployed on [uberspace](https://uberspace.de) and mostly hosts the addition of clients to employers. ~~It's written in php :disappointed: because~~ It's written in node.js. Use your own Mailgun key :smile:, you fill this in in your own `config.json`, just like `config.example.json`

1. fill in `config.json`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`
4. Have a drink :beer:
